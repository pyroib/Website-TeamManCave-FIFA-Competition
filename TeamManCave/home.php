			<p>On the TeamManCave Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1506550846043614/permalink/1960683973963630/">
					a poll</a> was held where players voted for the teams they want to see in the competition. The top 20 teams 
					voted in the poll became the 20 teams that are in the competition.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Once signed up, players were placed on the players list. (in sign up order)</li>
				<li>A player can have up to 3 teams</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Assigning Players to Teams</h2>	
			<p>The team &amp; players lists were then shuffled on <a href="https://www.random.org/lists/">
				random.org</a> and the team position in the list that matches the players position are the 
				team they play the entire season.</p>
